Each technique has unique properties that make it more suitable for particular applications. These applications can range from simply sensing the presence or change in the field to the precise measurements of a magnetic field's scalar and vector properties. A very good and exhaustive fundamental description of both mechanical and electrical means for sensing magnetic fields can be found in Lion [1]. Less detailed but more up-to-date surveys of magnetic sensor technologies can be found in [2, 3]. It is not possible to adequately describe all of these technologies in the space available in a Handbook. This chapter concentrates on sensors that are commonly used in magnetic field measuring instruments. As shown in Figure 48.1, magnetic field sensors can be divided into vector component and scalar magnitude types. The vector types can be further divided into sensors that are used to measure low fields ({\textless}1 mT) and high fields ({\textgreater}1 mT). Instruments that measure low fields are commonly called magnetom-eters . High-field instruments are usually called gaussmeters . The induction coil and fluxgate magnetometers are the most widely used vector measuring instru-ments. They are rugged, reliable, and relatively less expensive than the other low-field vector measuring instruments. The fiber optic magnetometer is the most recently developed low-field instrument. Although it currently has about the same sensitivity as a fluxgate magnetometer, its potential for better performance is large. The optical fiber magnetometer has not yet left the laboratory, but work on making it more rugged and field worthy is under way. The superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers are the most sensitive of all magnetic field measuring instruments. These sensors operate at temperatures near absolute zero and require special thermal control systems. This makes the SQUID-based magnetometer more expensive, less rugged, and less reliable. The Hall effect device is the oldest and most common high-field vector sensor used in gaussmeters. It is especially useful for measuring extremely high fields ({\textgreater}1 T). The magnetoresistive sensors cover the middle ground between the low-and high-field sensors. Anisotropic magnetoresistors (AMR) are cur-rently being used in many applications, including magnetometers. The recent discovery of the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) effect, with its tenfold improvement in sensitivity, promises to be a good competitor for the traditional fluxgate magnetometer in medium-sensitivity applications. The proton (nuclear) precession magnetometer is the most popular instrument for measuring the scalar magnetic field strength. Its major applications are in geological exploration and aerial mapping of the geomagnetic field. Since its operating principle is based on fundamental atomic constants, it is also used as the primary standard for calibrating magnetometers. The proton precession magnetometer has a very low sampling rate, on the order of 1 to 3 samples per second, so it cannot measure fast changes in the magnetic field. The optically pumped magnetometer operates at a higher sampling rate and is capable of higher sensitivities than the proton precession magnetometer, but it is more expensive and not as rugged and reliable. Table 48.1 lists various magnetic field strength instruments and their characteristics.},

abstract = {A Landmark text thoroughly updated, including a new CDAs digital devices continue to be produced at increasingly lower costs and with higher speeds, the need for effective electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design practices has become more critical than ever to avoid unnecessary costs in bringing products into compliance with governmental regulations. The Second Edition of this landmark text has been thoroughly updated and revised to reflect these major developments that affect both academia and the electronics industry. Readers familiar with the First Edition will find much new material, including:* Latest U.S. and international regulatory requirements* PSpice used throughout the textbook to simulate EMC analysis solutions* Methods of designing for Signal Integrity* Fortran programs for the simulation of Crosstalk supplied on a CD* OrCAD(r) PSpice(r) Release 10.0 and Version 8 Demo Edition software supplied on a CD* The final chapter on System Design for EMC completely rewritten* The chapter on Crosstalk rewritten to simplify the mathematicsDetailed, worked-out examples are now included throughout the text. In addition, review exercises are now included following the discussion of each important topic to help readers assess their grasp of the material. Several appendices are new to this edition including Phasor Analysis of Electric Circuits, The Electromagnetic Field Equations and Waves, Computer Codes for Calculating the Per-Unit-Length Parameters and Crosstalk of Multiconductor Transmission Lines, and a SPICE (PSPICE) tutorial.Now thoroughly updated, the Second Edition of Introduction to Electromagnetic Compatibility remains the textbook of choice for university/college EMC courses as well as a reference for EMC design engineers.An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available from the Wiley editorial department.},

@article{Krug2002,
abstract = {We report the three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation of gold nanoparticles with specific geometries as a means to the rational design of apertureless near-field scanning optical microscopy ?NSOM? probes. Analytical solutions for field enhancement by spheroidal particles are used to provide physical insight for probe design. These solutions indicate that probes need to be not only sharp, but also finite in length in order to generate the highest field enhancement. Finite difference time domain ?FDTD? simulations of gold particles illuminated by near infrared radiation are performed. Field enhancements for right trigonal pyramids are found to be size and wavelength dependent. Furthermore, the enhancements for these pyramidal particles are higher than for similar length conical particles, which in turn perform better than quasi-infinite conical probes. The particles we design with FDTD can be made using current nanofabrication techniques, and therefore hold great promise as apertureless NSOM probes. These right trigonal pyramids are particularly well suited for use in tip enhanced nonlinear optical microscopy or near-field Raman microscopy.},

@article{Yaghjian1986,
abstract = {After a brief history of near-field antenna measurements with and without probe correction, the theory of near-field antenna measurements is outlined beginning with ideal probes scanning on arbitrary surfaces and ending with arbitrary probes scanning on planar, cylindrical, and spherical surfaces. Probe correction is introduced for all three measurement geometries as a slight modification to the ideal probe expressions. Sampling theorems are applied to determine the required data-point spacing, and efficient computational methods along with their computer run times are discussed. The major sources of experimental error defining the accuracy of typical planar near-field measurement facilities are reviewed, and present limitations of planar, cylindrical, and spherical near-field scanning are identified.},

abstract = {Probes used for contactless electromagnetic field capture or injection are characterized. Depending on the probe structure, they interact preferentially with the electric or magnetic field. The optimal size of the probes for broad-frequency-band measurements is investigated. However, it is shown particularly for the magnetic field probe that considerations about the size and the structures presented in this paper are not sufficient for a good discrimination between electric and magnetic fields. Then, the space resolution of near-field measurements is discussed, with application to the field capture of a microstrip line under operation.},
